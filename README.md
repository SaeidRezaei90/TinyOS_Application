# TinyOS_Application
 Develope a TinyOS application in order to establish a connection between 2 motes to send data and simulate the application with TOSSIM.
 In this application we have 2 Micaz motes. The first mote sends periodic requests to second mote until it receives an acknowledgment. The simulation is done in TOSSIM and mote 1 starts at time 0 and mote 2 starts after 5 second. It should be mentioned that at first the second mote is off so basically the mote number one sends request to no one. But when the first request arrives because mode number 2 is booted, the mote number 1 also receives an acknowledgment for the request. After the mean time mote number 2 receives the response so it sends the response and mote number 1 receives the response and sends the ack. This request is periodic in every 1 second.
This message contains the type which is response or request and each of the requests has a counter. The counter will send by mote number 1 and the value from the fake sensor. Also we use TinyOs ACK module to acknowledge each request or response. For the packet acknowledgment we used commands in documentation. And when we are in send done we checked the message was acknowledged or not.
